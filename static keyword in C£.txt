static keyword in CÂ£:

- variable (data members)
- methods
- constructors
- class

static members (variable or method) can be accessible by using class name no need any object 

class demo 
{
	int x;
	static int y;
}

here "x" is non-static => for each object x has separate memory, store different values for each object

"y" is static => for whole class memory is allocated to "y", can store common value for each object
